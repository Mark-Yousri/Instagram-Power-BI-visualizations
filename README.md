Social media insights (Instagram) Visualizations using Power BI tool.

Power BI is a business analytics service by Microsoft that provides interactive visualizations and business intelligence capabilities. It can be used to visualize data from various sources, including Instagram, a social media platform that allows users to share photos and videos. Power BI can help users gain insights into their Instagram data, such as followers & engagement. Users can connect Instagram to Power BI without coding, using an ETL platform like Improvado that extracts, transforms, and loads the data to Power BI. Users can also customize their data visualizations with hundreds of templates and options available in Power BI or create their own visuals to suit their needs.
